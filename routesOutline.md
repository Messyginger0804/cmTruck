💯 Yup — you're thinking exactly like a lead dev.

Now that your **core project structure, env config, and backend layout** are locked in…

# ✅ The Next Logical Step is:

## 🧭 Designing the Endpoint Structure (Route Outline)

Why? Because once you define the shape of the endpoints, you can:
- Build the route files
- Know what models/schemas you need
- Tie services together (YOLO + LLM)
- Prepare frontend integration down the line

# 🛣️ **CM TruckEst API — Route Design Outline**

## 🔧 System Routes (Health & Debug)
| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `GET` | `/ping` | Healthcheck – is API up? |
| `GET` | `/version` | Return API + Model version info |

---

## 📸 Estimate Routes

### `POST /estimate/`
- Upload image + form (client name, vehicle info)
- Tower sends image to Pi (YOLO)
- Gets back YOLO results
- Sends YOLO results + form to Pi (LLM)
- Gets back summary
- Saves it all in DB
- Returns:
```json
{
  "estimate_id": "uuid",
  "repair_time_hours": 8,
  "damage_detected": true,
  "summary": "Front bumper damage...",
  "image_url": "/images/uuid.jpg"
}
```

---

### `GET /estimate/{id}`
- Retrieve one specific estimate
- Returns all stored data, YOLO JSON, and LLM summary

---

### `GET /estimates/`
- Admin dashboard use
- List all estimates (optionally paginated / searchable)

---

## 💬 Feedback Routes

### `POST /feedback/`
- Add client/shop feedback to an estimate
```json
{
  "estimate_id": "uuid",
  "feedback": "The repair took longer than expected due to parts."
}
```

---

## 🔒 Optional (Later) Auth Routes
| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/login` | POST | Auth system for shop dashboard |
| `/admin/estimates` | GET | Protected dashboard view |
| `/models/update` | POST | Upload new LLM or YOLO models |

---

## 📥 Upload & File Routes (Optional Later)
| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/upload/image` | POST | Manual image upload |
| `/files/images/{filename}` | GET | Serve saved image |

---

# 🧠 Next Steps After This:

1. Finalize the shape of each endpoint (params, response, validations)
2. Create `schemas.py` (Pydantic classes for request/response)
3. Create `models.py` (DB tables for Estimate & Feedback)
4. Build out route logic
5. Add storage handling for images + JSON outputs
6. Write service clients (to Pi: YOLO + LLM)

Let me know if you want me to:
✅ Write out all the schemas  
✅ Draft `models.py` for DB  
✅ Scaffold `estimate.py` route logic  

Say the word and I’ll start with that first piece!
