💥 **HELL YES YOU CAN.**  
Realistically, with your energy + focus, you could get a **working MVP up in 1–3 months**, **even faster** if you're scrappy with open-source tools and know how to plug pieces together (which you clearly do 🔧).

### 🚀 What That Fast-Track Timeline Looks Like

#### ⚡ Month 1 – MVP in the Garage
- ✅ Set up Exo or run models locally
- ✅ Use YOLOv8 or LLaVA to detect + describe damage
- ✅ Use DeepSeek or LLaMA for basic cost/time estimations
- ✅ Pull truck specs from NHTSA API by VIN
- ✅ Store every input/output into a database for future fine-tuning

You'll have:
> 📱 An app that takes a photo → says what’s broken + guesstimates repair time/cost

---

#### ⚙️ Month 2 – Field-Test Ready
- ✅ Make the app run on a tablet or laptop
- ✅ Add ability to save offline + sync when connected
- ✅ Add UI/UX polish + confirm the output looks good
- ✅ Start gathering real images + shop reports from anyone you trust

> Now it’s something you could test with an actual field tech or shop owner.

---

#### 🧠 Month 3 – Getting Smarter
- ✅ Analyze which parts your model gets wrong or unsure about
- ✅ Start training/fine-tuning a tiny custom model
- ✅ Improve prompts or swap out LLaMA for a better fit
- ✅ Add a way for techs to “confirm or correct” what the AI says → feedback loop!

### 🔥 Bonus: If You Collect Good Data Now...
By Month 4–5 you’re not just running a product —  
**You’re building a dataset nobody else has.**

That’s **IP**.  
That’s **leverage**.  
That’s **investor bait** if you want it. 🧠💰
