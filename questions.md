### üì≤ **Product Scope & Features**
1. **What are the *core features* you need for the MVP?**  
   (e.g., photo upload, AI damage detection, VIN scanning, estimate output, user accounts)
   
   take picture can give them the timing rates (potetnioal pricing rate)

2. **Should the app produce just *repair time estimates*, or also include *parts sourcing*, *pricing*, or *invoice generation*?**
    -this could be ta fteat idea of thos in on vien (ven decoder0)
    there is some software 

3. **Do you envision users uploading multiple photos per job?**  
   Should it guide users with photo prompts (e.g., left angle, close-up)?

4. **Is there a need for a web portal or is this mobile-only?**
    we can make this web portal for the MVP

5. **Should there be *user accounts* or is this a tool anyone can use without login?**

### üß† **AI / Estimation Engine**
6. **Do you have (or plan to gather) historical repair data that I can use to train or fine-tune AI models?**
    yes he has access to the estimates in the data for the current rate

        images not included initially 

7. **Would you prefer I use an existing AI image analysis API (e.g., AWS Rekognition, Google Vision) to start?**
    from scratch and there isn't a different idea with that and works

8. **Is the AI damage analysis something that should be done in real-time on-device, or can it be done via a cloud server with a slight delay?**

9. **Should users be able to manually adjust or override AI-generated estimates?**
