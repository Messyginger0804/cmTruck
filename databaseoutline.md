🔥 Great spot to be in — you’ve got routes live, endpoints responding, project structured for growth. Next step = **build your database layer.**

# ✅ Should You Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB?

For *CM TruckEst* → PostgreSQL is the better fit.

## 🔍 Why PostgreSQL Wins Here:

| Reason | PostgreSQL | MongoDB |
|--------|------------|---------|
| 🔧 Structured data (images, repair times, feedback) | ✅ Relational & consistent | ⚠️ Needs more structure handling |
| 🔁 Relationships (estimates → feedback) | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Manual referencing |
| 📊 Analytics / Queries later | ✅ Great for SQL joins, views | ❌ Harder to query complex data |
| 🧠 Model training dumps (CSV, filters) | ✅ Super easy | ❌ Requires transformation logic |
| 🔐 Reliability | ✅ Battle-tested | ✅ Also good |
| 💡 Vector DB add-on later? | ✅ Works well w/ pgvector | ✅ Works w/ Weaviate etc. |

## TL;DR:
If you were building a fast MVP for mobile image upload → Mongo is fine.  
But you’re building a **system with structure, history, model training, analytics** → PostgreSQL wins.

# ✅ Next Step: Let’s Build the Database Setup

We’ll do:
1. `.env` with DB credentials
2. `database.py` → SQLAlchemy + session
3. `models.py` → Estimate & Feedback tables
4. Test route that saves something to DB

## Want me to start with:
- `.env` DB section  
- `database.py` (PostgreSQL setup with SQLAlchemy engine)  
- `models.py` with your first tables  

Say the word and I’ll build it out in one clean drop.
