Perfect — let’s get the AI environment up and running on your server **right now** so you’re ready to start building and training your model.

## 🧠 Step 1: Set Up Your Python AI Environment on Ubuntu

### 1.1. ✅ Update your system
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

### 1.2. ✅ Install Python, pip, and venv
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
```

---

### 1.3. ✅ Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv truckest-ai
source truckest-ai/bin/activate
```

You’ll now see `(truckest-ai)` in your terminal — this means you’re working inside your isolated Python environment.

---

### 1.4. ✅ Install PyTorch and TorchVision

Visit [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the latest, but here’s a CPU-only install command to start:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

> If you ever add a GPU (NVIDIA), we’ll switch to the CUDA version.

---

## 📁 Step 2: Create the Project Folder
```bash
mkdir cmtruckest-ai && cd cmtruckest-ai
mkdir dataset model scripts
touch scripts/train.py scripts/infer.py
```

Folder breakdown:
```
/cmtruckest-ai
  /dataset        <-- For training images & labels
  /model          <-- Where your trained .pt file will go
  /scripts
    train.py      <-- Where you’ll build your training script
    infer.py      <-- Script to run inference (predictions)
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Confirm Everything Works
In `scripts/train.py`, try this simple test:

```python
import torch
print("Is CUDA available?", torch.cuda.is_available())
print("PyTorch version:", torch.__version__)
```

Run it:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

---

## ✅ What’s Next?

Once this is working, we’ll move on to:
1. Defining your image classification model (simple CNN)
2. Creating a labeled dataset (e.g., "minor", "moderate", "severe" damage)
3. Training it with `train.py`
4. Predicting with `infer.py`
5. Wrapping it into an API

Want me to generate a starter `train.py` with a basic CNN and dataset loader next?
